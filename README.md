### Hi there ☕

I'm Henry — a Computer Science student at Portland State slated to graduate in March 2024. Through being admitted into the PSU Cooperative Education Program (PCEP) internship, I have been given the opportunity to work with several Portland-based tech companies through varying 6-month positions.

This includes a Quality Assurance Automation Engineering role at Trimble Viewpoint where I created API tests in Cypress, front-end UI tests in Selenium, and API performance tests in BlazeMeter. In my latest internship role, I took on a Software Development position with Jama Software creating front-end components in React.js for their enterprise-facing application.

Through my studies and job experience, I have developed a drive for problem-solving and a hunger to learn more. I consistently find myself enveloped in whatever challenge rests in front of me, making use of both my own abilities as well as those around me. I can't wait to see what's to come, and please reach out to me as I'd love to share more.
