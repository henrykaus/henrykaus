### Hi there ☕

I'm Henry — a recent Computer Science graduate from Portland State University. Through being admitted into the PSU Cooperative Education Program (PCEP) internship, I have been given the opportunity to work with several Portland-based tech companies through varying 6-month positions.

This includes a Quality Assurance Automation Engineering role at Trimble Viewpoint where I created API tests in Cypress, front-end UI tests in Selenium, and API performance tests in BlazeMeter; a Software Engineering Frontend position with Jama Software where I created reusable and accessible UI components in React.js for their enterprise-facing application; and a final Software Engineering Backend role with Apex Fintech Solutions where I created ACATS-focused software solutions in Go, SQL Server, and Python.

Through my studies and job experience, I have developed a drive for problem-solving and a hunger to learn more. I consistently find myself enveloped in whatever challenge rests in front of me, making use of both my own abilities as well as those around me. I can't wait to see what's to come, and please reach out to me as I'd love to share more.
