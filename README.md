### Hi there ☕

I'm Henry — a Software Development Engineer in Test at Trimble Inc. and Computer Science graduate from Portland State University. By fully enveloping myself in my current role, various software engineering internships, and a full-stack web dev. position, I've gained a breadth of experience across accessible frontend development, quality assurance through test automation, and fintech-focused backend software solutions.

Through my studies and career experience, I've developed a drive for problem-solving and a hunger to learn more. I consistently find myself immersed in whatever challenge rests in front of me, making use of both my own abilities and placing high priority on collaboration with those around me. I'm excited to see where my career takes me, so please reach out as I'd love to share more.
